# Passwerd

A simple password generator built with Typescript, [`Bun`](https://bun.sh/package-manager) and [`Vite`](https://vite.dev/).

Uses modern browser's [`Crypto`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto) for baseline randomness, a safer method compared to `Math.random()`. Maybe not be available on older browsers, should probably fall back to [`Random package`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random).
